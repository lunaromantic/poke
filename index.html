    <p>so yeah hi lol <br>
    this'll be a website where it's a pokemon-click game sorta thing <br>
    i have absolutely no idea what im doing, but itll help me learn react, js, html, etc <br>
    <br>
    heres some features im planning on having - 
    <ul>
        <li>sign up / make your own account</li>
        <li>quiz to choose your starter pokemon (or you can just pick lol)</li>
        <li>create your own rescue team</li>
        <li>storyline just like in the pokemon mystery dungeon games</li>
        <li>unlock dungeons and explore them, random chance of finding items, money, pokemon, etc!</li>
        <li>rescue missions!</li>
        <li>upgrade your team base by using gems found in dungeons! <br> 
            as you increase your level for a certain type, you will have a higher chance of <br>
            recruiting pokemon of that type as well as finding a shiny in the dungeons!</li>
        <li>friend areas! each pokemon belongs in a different friend area</li>
    </ul></p>
